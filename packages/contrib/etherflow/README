This folder contains the interface to communicate between the
the board and computer via ethernet connection.

ethernet.c - file containing the interface functions:
- open_socket()
- close_socket()
- send_frame()
- receive_frame()

The functions are in C wrapped by "lua C api" and can be called 
from lua scripts.

Makefile - creates a libethernet.so (shared library) that allows
to use ethernet.c's functions by doing:
require 'libethernet' and calling functions like: libethernet.close_socket().

call_lib_receive.lua - an example for receiving frames;
 opens a socket,reads 10 frames in a loop printing each 
received frame in hexa, then closes the socket.
Should be called (the library should exist when called): 
lua call_lib_receive.lua  

call_lib_send.lua - an example for sending frames;
 opens a socket, sends 5 frames with 5 different strings, 
closes the socket.
Should be called (the library should exist when called): 
lua call_lib_send.lua
