Torch5 Library.
===============

Torch5 provides a Matlab-like environment for state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. It is easy to use and provides a very efficient implementation, thanks to an easy and fast scripting language (Lua) and a underlying C implementation.


XLearn Extension.
=================

Provides a bunch of new neural modules, learning methods (sparse coding), and lots of tools to interface cameras, videos, and create guis...
