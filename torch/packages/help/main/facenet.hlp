<extended>Training a neural net to detect faces.

To be documented.

For now, simply checkout =demos/train-on-faces.lua=. You can train in minutes:

<verbatim>
$ ./get-dataset faces
$ cd demos; qlua train-on-faces.lua
</verbatim>

A result of that trainer is already provided in =trained-nets/network-face-detect=.
