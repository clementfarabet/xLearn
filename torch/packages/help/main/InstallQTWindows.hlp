Appendix: Install QT 4.4 under Windows

Download [[http://trolltech.com/downloads/opensource/appdev/windows-cpp][QT 4.4 sources for Windows]]
on Trolltech website.

Unzip then and move the directory to =C:\Qt=.

Set the system =PATH= such that it contains =C:\Qt\bin=. It can be done by
opening the Control Panel, then System, then go to Advanced and then
Environment Variables. Make sure you do that before compilation. The Torch
configuration procedure also needs it for finding QT.

Considering you have Microsoft Visual Studio, you can then do:
<verbatim>
cd c:\Qt
configure -release
nmake
</verbatim>
Given the size of QT, allow few hours for compilation.
